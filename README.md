SORTING VISUALIZER PROJECT
The “Sorting Spectacle” project is basically a web development project which is used to visualize the sorting algorithms and performs the operation of algorithms step by step as the algorithms works like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort , Insertion Sort etc. We shuffle the bars in a random order that is in a unsorted order. 

We perform sorting algorithms on these bars to sort these bars in a descending order by applying the different algorithms by clicking on the buttons of these sorting algorithms.
